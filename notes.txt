For testing in multicore on the board, change the scheduler in monitor.h defines.
Just the start_scheduler, the end_scheduler should remain SCHED_OTHER (default of the system).

The defines of binding and scheduling put into effect in worker.cc functions.

Perf configuration bit, mask ecc is in worker.cc .
